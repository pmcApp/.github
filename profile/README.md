# pmcApp
pmcApp is a project that builds a lot of package stacks on npm and Node.js. The purpose of this project is to gather all package managers under one roof and manage from there. Some projects may not work properly because they are newly developed. Therefore, they will be in testing/beta or alpha until full versions are released. These may vary by project. You can write your suggestions about projects by explaining them in the `discussion` section of the project file named `/help`.
